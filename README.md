# Employee Payroll Tracker

Description:

-Greetings! 

-This is my modification to the  JavaScript starter code initially provided in the assignement. I have not altered the original HTML and CSS languages provided.

-It is my intention to enable the intended user (an associate/manager handling  employee payroll of a company) to view and manage employee payroll data. The user will be prompted to enter as many employees as the wish (they will be prompt to provide nominal background information about each employee; such as first and last names, and salary). From this, the user wil be able to acquire a list of all the employees (alonw with their infomation) they have entered; aswell as calculate the average employee salary.
